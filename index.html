            <h1>Eilean donan castle</h1>
            <p>Eilean Donan Castle is one of the most famous and beautiful castles in Scotland.
                 Located on a small island where three sea lochs meet—Loch Duich, Loch Long, and Loch Alsh—this castle stands as a symbol of Scottish history, resilience, and natural beauty.
                  Its stunning setting and rich past make it a popular destination for tourists and historians alike.
                The castle was originally built in the 13th century to defend against Viking invasions and to protect the lands of the Clan Mackenzie.
                 Over the centuries, it played an important role in Scotland’s turbulent history, especially during the Jacobite risings in the 17th and 18th centuries.
                  Unfortunately, the castle was heavily damaged and fell into ruin after being attacked in 1719.</p>
